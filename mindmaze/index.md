## Why?
After spending hours surfing the internet, I stumbled upon tons of interesting stuff that I wanted to keep track of. But I couldn't remember it all, no matter how hard I tried to organize my bookmarks. So, I decided to use Obsidian to link my notes together and make sense of it all. And to share my findings with others easily, I turned it into a website using mkdocs. So here it is, my online treasure trove for everyone to explore!
