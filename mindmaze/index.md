# Mindmaze
My second brain that leverages the power of Obsidian

## Why?
After spending hours surfing the internet, I stumbled upon tons of interesting stuff that I wanted to keep track of. But I couldn't remember it all, no matter how hard I tried to organize my bookmarks. So, I decided to use Obsidian to link my notes together and make sense of it all. And to share my findings with others easily, I turned it into a website using mkdocs. So here it is, my online treasure trove for everyone to explore!

### Inspirations
The folders are organized in a system designed by [Johnny Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com/). However, I suspect it will have multiple files scattered within folders. So, for now, I am not following any naming conventions for files. To see the connections, we can use Graph view in [[Obsidian]].

Not only this, I have decided to Code in Public, which means I will keep my code up to date in GitHub and write blogs about it. Probably I will create some YouTube videos, if time permits.
